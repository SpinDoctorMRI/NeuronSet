#Surface meshes#

We generate surface meshes for 1,163 neurons and 50 glia from NeuroMorpho.org.
In each archive, containing:

1. CITATION.bib of the archive;
2. surface_meshes.zip, containing .ply format surfaces meshes files;
3. swc_files.zip, caontaining neuron shape files in .swc format, downloading from NeuroMorpho.org;
4. measurement_NMO.csv, containing morphological paramters uploading by archive owner;
5. metadata.csv, containing metadata of each neuron;
6. morpho_measure.csv, containing morphological parameters measured by finite element meshes.
