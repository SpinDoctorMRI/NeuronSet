# Surface meshes #

We generate high-quality surface meshes for 1,163 neurons and 50 glia from NeuroMorpho.org.

Each archive contains:
1. CITATION.bib of the citation of the archive;
2. surface_meshes.txt, containing the link to download the zip file of .ply surface meshes;
3. swc_files.zip, containing neuron shape files in .swc format, downloading from NeuroMorpho.org;
4. measurement_NMO.csv, containing  morphological parameters uploaded by archive owner;
6. metadata.csv, containing metadata of each neuron;
7. morpho_measure.csv, containing morphological parameters measured by finite element meshes.
