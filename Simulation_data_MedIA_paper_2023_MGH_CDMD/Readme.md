#Simulation data for the paper in Medical Image Analysis in 2023#

Simulation data for the paper "A simulation-driven supervised learning framework to estimate brain microstructure using diffusion MRI".

Each row of the table contains

1. The neuron's id in NeuroMorpho.org;
2. The neuron's name;
3. The archive's name to which it belongs to;
4. 90 simulated direction-average diffusion MRI signals, with 2 sequences and 45 g-values. The firt number of the header is the index of sequence and the second number is the index of the g-values.
